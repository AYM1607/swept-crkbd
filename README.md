# Swept crkbd

Pictures pending.

## What is the swept crkbd?

The Swept Crkbd is a mix between the [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) (which is itself a version of the [Ferris](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris)) and the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).

## Motivation

I made the jump from a 60% qwerty keyboard to colemak mod-dh on a sweep. After getting up to speed both with the new layout and form factor I realized that to reach peak productivity I'd need a few more keys and. The corne was the obvious choice but the non-choc spacing,
lack support for a power switch and the less aggresive staggering made me miss the sweep, so I decided to take the sweep as a starting point and add the extra keys by keeping it wireless friendly. The [Corne-is Zen](https://lowprokb.ca/products/corne-ish-zen) has similar
goals but is not always in stock and is closed source.

## What are the different types?

There's currently only one version of the swept with choc spacing as well as an on-off switch and no TRRS connector, this is to have the reset switch in a more comfortable position.,

## Components list

To build and use a Swept you will need:

* 1x PCB Kit.
* 2 nice!nanos.
* 42 Choc v1 switches.
* 42 keycaps.
* 2x reset switches ([B3U-1000P(M)](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/issues/20)) If you live in the US, [this kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LCBLB8N?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) includes switches that fit.
* Rubber feet, [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CNQC695?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) work great.
* 2x power switches. [these](https://www.amazon.com/Gikfun-Switch-Toggle-Arduino-AE1073/dp/B01GFFGA4I/ref=psdc_495324_t1_B07SJWWYZP) work great.
* 1 USB C cable.

## How do I make this thing?

Build video coming soon.

## Firmware

Firmware for zmk and nice!nano is called ["Corne"](https://zmk.dev/docs/hardware/).
